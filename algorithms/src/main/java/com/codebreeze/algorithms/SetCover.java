/**
 * The set cover problem is as follows: given a set of subsets S1, S2, S3, .., Sm of the universal
 * set U = {1, ...., n}, find the smallest subset of subsets T belongs to S such that these cover
 * the super set completely. For example, there are the following subsets, S1 = {1,3,5}, S2 = {2,4}
 * , S3 = {1,4}, and S4 = {2,5}. The set cover would then be S1 and S2.
